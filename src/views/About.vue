      In the summer of 2020, I graduated from Henderson State University with a
      Bachelors's in Computer Science. I've always enjoyed programming but,
      after school, I discovered that I had a passion for web development.
      <br />
      I currently work in Technical Operations at Apptegy, but I try to work on
      projects and learn code in my free time. Iâ€™m currently focusing on
      learning more about Vue and I'm working on a new social media application
      to help. Feel free to view my progress in the Projects tab!
